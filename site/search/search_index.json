Please review the details related to data structure options and access methods described here to identify the best match for your needs. Temporal Structure Details Native Unmodified Data All sensor data received by CORIOLIX are archived as ASCII flat files, one file per sensor per day. The unmodified raw messages (strings) are stored at the native resolution collected by the sensor. The format of the strings varies by sensor. Each message string is prepended with the UTC timestamp of receipt. No quality control has been performed on these data. High Resolution Date For real-time applications, a subset of sensor data are extracted and stored within CORIOLIX. These searchable datasets are available at 1 Hz resolution or below. The collection timestamps and data values are unmodified. Preliminary quality control flags are provided as an additional field. Binned Data These data are provided in temporal (e.g. one-minute) bins. The mean and accompanying statistics are provided. Preliminary quality flags are included. Binning Method Data are binned using an (unweighted) mean over a set time interval. Statistics are also captured (std, min, max, num, spotval, median) and made available to the end-user. Circular data (such as heading or wind direction) are averaged using circular mean and circular standard deviation calculations. For example, the circular average of 355 and 5 is 0 not 180. Vector data (such as true winds) are averaged using vector averaging. First, the components (u,v,w) are each averaged using a simple mean. These mean components are then used to derive the mean direction and mean magnitude: mean_direction = rad2deg(atan2(mean_u, mean_v)) + 180 mean_magnitude = sqrt(mean_u^2 + mean_v^2) Binning Time Interval All parameters are binned by default to 1-minute bins, centered on \"nice\" minute timestamps (12:03:00, 12:04:00, etc). On request prior to a cruise, binned data at a second (custom) time interval may also be generated for that cruise. Data collected less frequently than every minute (e.g. ceilometer data are collected every six minutes) are populated with NaNs between data points. The timestamp provided with each bin is the center time of the bin. Date Range Binned data are stored and available only for the past X days. The number of days can be configured from 10 - 365 days (90 days is recommended) on the Data/Access/Archive page. Binned Data Quality Three binned products are provided: \"All\", \"Best\", and \"SAMOS\". The distinction is the quality of data used to calculate the bin. All Bins (a) The \"all\" binned product bins all data points within the time interval regardless of quality. Quality flags are ignored. Best Bins (b) Best bins are derived only from data that have flag values of 0, 1, or 2 (i.e. no suspect or failed data). For example, if there are 10 data points within the binning time interval, and one of them has a flag set to \"fail\", only the remaining 9 data points are used to calculate the bin value. Special note: QA/QC happens at various stages throughout the data lifecycle. \"Best\" bins are regenerated (a) at various stages of the automated QA/QC process, (b) on demand by the sensor technician during the manual QA/QC process, and (c) at the end of the cruise. As a consequence, the \"best\" binned values may change throughout the cruise. Data earlier in the lifecycle will, by definition, have fewer opportunities for flags to be set to \"suspect\" or \"fail\". SAMOS Bins (c) The third binned product, \"SAMOS\", uses only a subset of flags to determine whether data should be included in the bin or not. Data must pass only the following four quality tests to be included in the bin: (1) Gap Test (2) Syntax Test (3) Gross Range Test (4) Global Range Test SAMOS performs further quality assessment on these binned data. Binned Quality Flags Quality flags representing the binned data are a composite of all of the flags from that bin. For each flag position, the largest value is used in the composite binned flag. For example: Individual Data Flags 111144000022222222111100000000 121122000033222222114400000000 Composite Flag 121144000033222222114400000000 Special note: QA/QC happens at various stages throughout the data lifecycle. As a consequence, the composite quality flags may change throughout the cruise. Binned Data Structure A file with a single day of one-minute binned data will contain 1440 rows (60 minutes * 24 hours). Each downloaded binned data file contains the following columns: Datetime: the center timestamp of the bin Latitude: the latitude closest in time to the bin center timestamp (a spot value) Longitude: the longitude closest in time to the bin center timestamp (a spot value) Parameter Data: a JSON dictionary containing the binned data and statistics Multiple parameters may be included in a single file (one column per parameter). Binned data and statistics for a given parameter and time bin are stored as a JSON dictionary. An example follows below: { \"a\": [ 359.017, 5.259, 0.1, 359.9, 120, 359.5, -999 ], \"b\": [ 358.982, 5.321, 1, 359.9, 117, 359.5, -999 ], \"c\": [ 358.982, 5.321, 1, 359.9, 117, 359.5, -999 ], \"fa\": \"224122222222222222222222222222\", \"fb\": \"221122222222222222222222222222\", \"fc\": \"221122222222222222222222222222\", \"sa\": \"2021-05-06 22:12:59Z\", \"sb\": \"2021-05-06 22:12:59Z\", \"sc\": \"2021-05-06 22:12:59Z\" } where: \"a\": all array (mean, std, min, max, num, spot, median) \"b\": best array (mean, std, min, max, num, spot, median) \"c\": samos array (mean, std, min, max, num, spot, median) \"fa\": all flag (combination of flags from the data used to derive the \"all\" bins) \"fb\": best flags (combination of flags from the data used to derive the \"best\" bin) \"fc\": samos flag (combination of flags from the data used to derive the \"samos\" bin) \"sa\": spot datetime (all) \"sb\": spot datetime (best) \"sc\": spot datetime (samos) Spot values are unmodified data values that were collected closest in time to the center time of the bin.

This guide assumes that the new sensor has been deployed on the vessel and that the sensor is operational and configured to output RS-232 serial data. Step 1. Create a new sensor in CORIOLIX Logging data to CORIOLIX first requires the creation of a sensor record in the CORIOLIX database. Because CORIOLIX manages all phases of the data lifecycle, and not simply logging, it requires us to specify a diverse and comprehensive set of metadata up front. While all metadata fields are not strictly required, best practice is to maintain all fields. First, ensure that you are logged in and viewing the Sensor Details & Logs Page. This is where all new sensor records are created. Choose the \"Add New\" option at the top left corner of the Sensor Details and Logs table. This will load the New sensor setup form. Sensor Overview Sensor ID - 6 digit alphanumeric identifier + last 6 digits of serial number Sensor Name - Name provided by the manufacturer Class - Generic classification used in CORIOLIX for grouping plots and displays Type - Controlled NURC vocabulary options Vendor - Controlled NURC vocabulary options Serial Number - as marked on the instrument Description - Free text Native Data Feed Signal Type - Analog, Digital, or Derived (NOTE: only use Derived for synthetic sensors such as True Winds or similar) Comm Type - Choose the analog carrier or the digital transmission protocol Serial Details - Leave empty for non-serial instruments Ethernet Details - Leave empty for non-ethernet enabled instruments Native File Details - Complete only if the sensor data must be read from a file. Native Data Format Native Data Description - Free text Native Data Type - For digital data types, is the data encoded as text or binary? Sample Data Message(s) - Capture one or more messages from the instrument and add them here for use in developing the Message Format String parsing expression. Message Format String - A regular expression for parsing messages to named variables. Using our 3D anemometer example message of \"B, -000.08, +000.03, +000.01, M, +344.17, +020.92, 00, 3A\" We want/need to parse out the following 6 values from the message and assign them names: unit_id = B U_speed = -000.08 V_speed = 000.03 W_speed = 000.01 SOS = 344.17 Sonic_temp = 20.92 Status = 00 checksum = 3A To build a regex parser, first remember to enclose everything in [''] Next add a start of line character, ^, to make: ['^'] Next add in one open and closed parentheses pair, comma separated, for each value to parse to make: ['^(),(),(),(),(),()'] Add in any characters for unused message parts to make: ['^(),(),(),(),M,(),()'] Finally write the unique parse and name assignment regex for each variable and insert into the appropriate positional parenthetical. Use the (? regex) format to match patterns and assign names. To parse the letter \"B\" and assign it to the variable \"unit_id\" requires this parse string (?P \\w+). Our Message Format String is now: ['^(?P \\w+),(),(),(),(),()'] Continue to build your parse string. Use the Verify Format button to test your parser.

The cruise chart page also has built-in integrations with the Cruise Event Log and Route Planning tools. Basic Map controls: Basic map controls include the \"out-of-the-box\" and ubiquitous Zoom , Pan , and Mouse Coordinates leaflet controls for navigation. Zoom Located in the upper lefthand corner of the map pane. Click + to zoom in, click - to zoom out. Pan Left click, hold and drag on the map to pan (note: no graphic of this operation). Mouse Coordinates Located in the lower righthand corner of the map pane. Provides coordinate readout (decimal degrees) for mouse pointer location. Menu Bar controls: Menu Bar controls are custom controls to the CORIOLIX charting interface. You may expand any of the controls by selecting its icon from the thin Menu Bar ribbon along the righthand side of the map pane. Layer Control Located in at the top of the Menu Bar, the Layer Control provides a interface for toggling layer visibility on the map. Background Layers: Background layers are externally sourced, locally cached, map services that provide geographic 'background' context to the charting interface. One and only one background layer is always active, but we've selected three background layers to choose from. You may add additional layers by request or by editing the map configuration file. Open Streetmap Global Multi-Resolution Topography Synthesis (https://www.gmrt.org/) NOAA Electronic Nautical Charts (NOAA ENCs) Raster Overlays Raster overlays are similar to background layers. They are also externally sourced, locally cached, map services that provide local context to the charting interface. However, raster layers are off (inactive) by default. When activated (selected) they plot on top of the background layers. We've provided two default raster layers. Currently the latest image is provided by default and there is no user control for vieweing past (out of date) imagery. 8-Day Composite Global SST 8-Day Composite Global Chl-a conentration Ship Track Data This grouping presents the ship navigation in trackpoint (navigation fixes) or trackline (navigation path) format. Note that trackpoints are clickable and will open a pop-up with Heading, COG, and SOG data relevant to the trackpoint of interest. Underway Science Data This grouping includes trackpoint overlays organized into two instrument class groups, Flowthrough and Met. & Atmospheric. All points are clickable - to show relevant sensor data observations at that point, and may be colorized by unique instrument parameter via the settings tools. Custom Routing Located just below the Layer Control in the Menu Bar, the Custom Routing controls provide a user interface for creating new routes (routes are defined here as simple line or polyline shapes stored as geoJSON in the CORIOLIX database). Users may draw a route on the map, calculate route distance, and also the time required to complete route under various transit speeds. Events All cruise events are available for visualization in the charting interface. The Events control, immediately below the Custom Routing control, provides the user a mechanism to toggle event visibility. Place a check next to any event that you would like to make visible in the map view.
