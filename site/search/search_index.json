It presents a dynamic map view of the vessel, its realtime data, and supporting geospatial information such as nearby research infrastructure, routes, and waypoints. The cruise chart page also has built-in integrations with the Cruise Event Log and Route Planning tools. Basic Map controls: Basic map controls include the \"out-of-the-box\" and ubiquitous Zoom , Pan , and Mouse Coordinates leaflet controls for navigation. Zoom Located in the upper lefthand corner of the map pane. Click + to zoom in, click - to zoom out. Pan Left click, hold and drag on the map to pan (note: no graphic of this operation). Mouse Coordinates Located in the lower righthand corner of the map pane. Provides coordinate readout (decimal degrees) for mouse pointer location. Menu Bar controls: Menu Bar controls are custom controls to the CORIOLIX charting interface. You may expand any of the controls by selecting its icon from the thin Menu Bar ribbon along the righthand side of the map pane. Layer Control Located in at the top of the Menu Bar, the Layer Control provides a interface for toggling layer visibility on the map. Two background layers are provided, NOAA Raster Nautical Charts (NOAA RNCs) and the Global Multi-Resolution Topography Synthesis (https://www.gmrt.org/) The Ship Route Data grouping includes cruise track overlays for resident sensors and instrumentation. The Raster Overlays is a demonstration of using ERDDAP to support a science mission with CORIOLIX. In this demonstration case we have created a subscription for 8-day satellite SST and Chl composite imagery using our ERDDAP service onship and onshore. The ERDDAP server manages the once daily data update and serves the imagery to the map viewer. We also include overlays served from off-ship locations (clicking these will generate offship data requests), including: - NOAA OCS Wrecks & Obstructions Database - Weather Overlays from NOAA NowCOAST Custom Routing Located just below the Layer Control in the Menu Bar, the Custom Routing controls provide a user interface for creating new routes (routes are defined here as simple line or polyline shapes stored as geoJSON in the CORIOLIX database).

After that we should be able to remote in and complete the setup (and run some tests). thanks, Chris 1 Background Physical Equipment Information Server Make/Model: Dell PowerEdge R440 1U Server Server Name: Arcadia Server OS: CentOS7 Account Information Local User Account: rcrv Local User Account Password: Please contact Chris or Jasmine Network Information Three Virtual Machines are run on the arcadia server 1. endeavor-agg-ship - reads data from the network and writes data to local database 2. endeavor-pub-ship - holds a copy of the data and services the shipboard web user interface 3. map-endeavor-ship - a local mapserver to run the mapping/charting tools Each machine is presented to the Endeavor shipboard wired network via a bridge on arcadia\u2019s em1 interface. Therefore, all 4 systems share one wired physical connection (only one network drop is required). PHYSICAL SERVER (arcadia): 192.168.2.9 VM 1 (endeavor-agg-ship): 192.168.2.32 VM 2 (endeavor-pub-ship): 192.168.2.33 VM 3 (map-endeavor-ship): 192.168.2.34 2 Installation Procedures Overview: The following procedure covers physical installation and cabling of the CORIOLIX server: arcadia on R/V Endeavor. Install Host: Arcadia Install arcadia in the Main Lab rack location where previously installed. Secure with makeshift metal \"tabs\". Connect power to both power supplies on the rear of the server. Connect a network drop from the 192.168.2.0/24 network to eth1 on the arcadia. Optionally, connect a keyboard, mouse, and display 3 Startup & Shutdown Procedures Overview: The following procedure covers starting the CORIOLIX system. Please note that the host server arcadia is setup such that the CORIOLIX Virtual Machines start automatically. The CORIOLIX services installed on each Virtual Machine are also set to start automatically. This means that you only need to work though the first section \"Startup Host: Arcadia\" and may safely skip the subsequent startup steps. Nonetheless, we'll include complete manual Startup procedures here to provide you the options and instructions for starting CORIOLIX VMs or CORIOLIX services manually. Instructions for manual startup should be performed in sequence as presented. For shutdown we currently advise that you follow the manual shutdown instructions under sections \"Shutdown CORIOLIX services\", \"Shutdown VM's: 1, 2, & 3\", and \"Shutdown Host\". The virtualized system has proven to be robust to controlled shutdowns and restarts of arcadia (where the hypervisor manages the VM shutdowns) - but, we have additional testing to perform before we can be assured that this type of shytdown won't cause issue. Startup Host: Arcadia Press power button on front to start server, allows machine to boot. At CentOS login use the rcrv account Right click on the network connections icon in the upper right of the desktop. Set the em1 interface to be DHCP and check that the Endeavor DHCP server assigns the local 192.168.2.9 address to arcadia. Test dns by pinging google ( ping 8.8.8.8 ) or something like that \u2013 server needs to see the outside world. If server gets expected IP ( 192.168.2.9 ) and can ping off-ship then we are good to start VM\u2019s Note: After completing the setup above and finishing with arcadia on the Endeavor network at 192.168.2.9 you no longer need to keep a keyboard, mouse, and monitor to work with Arcadia. You can disconnect those input and display devices. The remaining setup steps may be performed through an ssh connection to Arcadia Startup VMs: 1, 2, & 3 From your local machine on the 192.168.2.0/24 network open a terminal window or your ssh client Make an SSH connection from your local terminal to arcadia: >> ssh rcrv@192.168.2.9 >> password: (enter user rcrv password) Change to the root user: >> sudo su - root >> password: (enter user rcrv password) List available virtual machines: >> virsh list --all Expected List Results (id may vary): Id Name State ---------------------------------------------------- 1 endeavor-agg-ship stopped 2 endeavor-map-ship stopped 4 endeavor-pub-ship stopped Start each VM from the command line ( Note : VM startups usually take less about 60-90 seconds each.): >> sudo virsh start endeavor-agg-ship >> sudo virsh start endeavor-pub-ship >> sudo virsh start endeavor-map-ship Expected Startup Results: Id Name State ---------------------------------------------------- 1 endeavor-agg-ship running 2 endeavor-map-ship running 4 endeavor-pub-ship running Exit your ssh connection to arcadia >> exit Startup CORIOLIX services The following services must be manually started on each virtual machine: vm: endeavor-agg-ship vm: endeavor-pub-ship service: sym_service service: sym_service service: coriolix service: coriolix service: mqtt * *There is no mqtt service on endeavor-pub-ship To start CORIOLIX follow the workflow below.

Therefore, all 4 systems share one wired physical connection (only one network drop is required). PHYSICAL SERVER (laconia): 192.168.1.164 VM 1 (ptsur-agg-ship): 192.168.1.161 VM 2 (ptsur-pub-ship): 192.168.1.162 VM 3 (ptsur-maps-ship): 192.168.1.163 2 Installation Procedures Overview: The following procedure covers physical installation and cabling of the CORIOLIX server: laconia on R/V Point Sur. Install Host: laconia Install laconia in rack location of your choice. Connect power to both power supplies on the rear of the server. Connect a network drop from the 192.168.1.0/24 network to Gb1 on the laconia. Optionally, connect a keyboard, mouse, and display 3 Startup & Shutdown Procedures Overview: The following procedure covers starting the CORIOLIX system. Please note that the host server laconia is setup such that the CORIOLIX Virtual Machines start automatically. The CORIOLIX services installed on each Virtual Machine are also set to start automatically. This means that you only need to work though the first section \"Startup Host: Laconia\" and may safely skip the subsequent startup steps. Nonetheless, we'll include complete manual startup procedures here to provide you the options and instructions for starting CORIOLIX VMs or CORIOLIX services manually. Instructions for manual startup should be performed in sequence as presented. For shutdown we currently advise that you follow the manual shutdown instructions under sections \"Shutdown CORIOLIX services\", \"Shutdown VM's: 1, 2, & 3\", and \"Shutdown Host\". The virtualized system has proven to be robust to controlled shutdowns and restarts of laconia (where the hypervisor manages the VM shutdowns) - but, we have additional testing to perform before we can be assured that this type of shutdown won't cause issue. Startup Host: Laconia Press power button on front to start server, allows machine to boot. At CentOS login use the rcrv account Right click on the network connections icon in the upper right of the desktop. Set the eno1 interface to be DHCP and check that the Point Sur DHCP server assigns the local 192.168.1.164 address to laconia. Test DNS by pinging google ( ping 8.8.8.8 ) or something like that \u2013 server needs to see the outside world. If server gets expected IP ( 192.168.1.164 ) and can ping off-ship then we are good to start VM\u2019s Note: After completing the setup above and finishing with laconia on the Point Sur network at 192.168.1.164 you no longer need to keep a keyboard, mouse, and monitor plugged in to work with laconia.
