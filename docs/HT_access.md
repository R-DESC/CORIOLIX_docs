# Accessing the CORIOLIX user interface(s):

Please note that we currently (Fall 2020) maintain four public facing CORIOLIX websites, one for system demonstration use and three for test deployments on Endeavor, Point Sur, and Sikuliaq.

Please note that the Shipboard user interface (website) is only available locally on the shipboard LAN (by design it can't be accessed by users from shore). Also note that the Shoreside user interface, while accessible from the ship (in public ip space), is NOT INTENDED to be accessed from the ship. Please use only the shipboard interface while on ship. It won't hurt anything but your satisfaction will be much higher if you use the intended interface. Finally, for our CORIOLIX demonstration system there is only a shoreside interface.

## CORIOLIX Demonstration Site:

The CORIOLIX demonstration site is meant to provide an "always-ready" demonstration tool for the CORIOLIX system. All data are simulated for the demonstration website. You'll find the CORIOLIX demonstration site at:
