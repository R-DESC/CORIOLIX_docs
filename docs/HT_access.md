# Accessing the CORIOLIX user interface(s):

Please note that currently, Fall 2023, there are three  public facing CORIOLIX shoreside websites:

* RV Endeavor
* RV Point Sur
* RV Sikuliaq

Please also note that the shipboard interface to CORIOLIX (website) is only available locally on your shipboard LAN (by design it can't be accessed by users from shore). 

In contrast, the shoreside CORIOLIX user interface may be accessed from ship or from shore. When on ship, use the ship's interface for best performance.
