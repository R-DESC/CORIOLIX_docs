# Accessing the CORIOLIX user interface(s):

Please note that currently, Spring 2022, we maintain two public facing CORIOLIX websites, one for Endeavor and the other for Point Sur.

Please also note that the shipboard interface to CORIOLIX (CORIOLIX website) is only available locally on your shipboard LAN (by design it can't be accessed by users from shore). In contrast, the shoreside CORIOLIX user interface may be accessed from ship or from shore. When on ship, use the ship's CORIOLIX interface for best performance.
