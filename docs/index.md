# CORIOLIX Documentation

**Version 1.3.0** • *Updated November 2025*

## Overview

CORIOLIX (**C**ruise **O**bservation **R**eal-Time **I**nterface for **L**ive **I**nformation **E**xchange) is a comprehensive real-time oceanographic data acquisition and processing system developed for research vessels in the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF).

!!! info "Current Status"
    CORIOLIX is actively deployed on Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRVs) and continues to expand its capabilities for the oceanographic research community.

## Background

CORIOLIX was developed during the construction of the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRVs) for the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF) and established as an ARF Specialized Service Pilot in 2023. The system addresses the critical challenge of ship-to-shore data transmission limitations that have historically kept valuable scientific observations "locked up" onboard until vessels return to port.

## Key Features

### 🔄 Real-Time Data Access
Stream oceanographic data from ship to shore with minimal latency, enabling real-time decision making and adaptive sampling strategies.

### 📊 Comprehensive Data Management
- **Sensor Catalog**: Complete inventory of onboard instrumentation
- **Data Acquisition Configuration**: Flexible setup for diverse sensor systems
- **Data Processing**: Automated quality control and processing pipelines
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and verification tools

### 🌐 Web-Based Interface
Access all system features through an intuitive web interface designed for both shipboard and shoreside users.

### 🔌 API Integration
Robust REST API for integration with external systems and custom applications.

## System Capabilities

CORIOLIX provides the following core services:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sensor Management** | Configure, monitor, and control onboard instruments |
| **Data Acquisition** | Real-time collection from multiple sensor systems |
| **Data Processing** | Automated processing pipelines with quality control |
