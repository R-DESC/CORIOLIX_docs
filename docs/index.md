# CORIOLIX Documentation
CORIOLIX Version X.Y.Z (will officially mark at Sikuliaq 2023 update)

## Background

CORIOLIX (**C**ruise **O**bservation **R**eal-Time **I**nterface for **L**ive **I**nformation **E**xchange) 
was developed during the construction of the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV's) for the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF) and established as an ARF Specialized Service Pilot in 2023. 

## Use Case

Ship to shore communications have always been limited by the reality that over-the-horizon communication pathways are complex, latent, and expensive.  Under these conditions, quantitative scientific observations (data) typically remain 'locked up' onboard until the ship arrived back in port.  

CORIOLIX was designed to unlock the vessel data and provide shoreside access in near real-time by poviding the following services accessible through a web interface:

* Sensor Catalog
* Data Acquisition Configuration
* Data Processing
* Local Data Access
* Remote (shoreside) Data Access
* Quality Assurance
