# Sensors Pages

## Sensor Details & Logs
This page presents a tabular list of all scientific sensor equipment known to the system.  Grey shaded rows indicate that the sensor is currently disabled, white rows indicate that the sensor is currently enabled.  Rows may be sorted (forward or reverse) alphabetically by one of multiple fields using the arrow symbols that surround field names.  Anonymous users will see options to view metadata and realtime plots as well as acess the data.  Authenticated users with elevated permissions will be granted additional options including methods to modify or create new metadata.

## Parameter Details
In a similar fashion to the Sensor Details & Logs page, the Parameter Details page presents tabular list of all known parameters. The parameters table follows the same enabled/disabled display convention as the Sensor Details & Logs table, and has the same sort capability and restricted edit functionality.
