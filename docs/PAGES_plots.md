# Sensor Plots Pages

The sensor plots pages are system specific (Flowthrough & Meteorological) groupings of 2-D real-time displays. The options in the dropdown menu take users to sensor plots pages with an integrated (overlay) display of all sensors belonging to a system for quick and easy visual comparison. We also include a data access interface on each plots page. There are also two types of customizable plots page for users to create their own plots. Details on the customizable plots are below.  

## Manipulating The Plots
Running your cursor over a plot will give you an information box over the plot that shows the timestamp, the parameter, and the measurement wherever your cursor is. 
Scrolling down on a plot will zoom out centering on where your cursor is. Scrolling up on a plot will zoom in on a plot centering on where your cursor is. 
The scroll bars on the axes also move the plots. The timestamps on either end of the X axis tell you the temporal range of the plot while the numbers on the Y axis will give you the range of the measurements of a given parameter. Clicking and dragging inside the box will zoom in to the section you have selected. Clicking and dragging the top of the bar will move the plot while keeping the length of time or measurement range the same. You can also click and drag the sides of the bar to extend or shorten the ranges displayed on the plot.

There are icons to the right of each plot that change how it is displayed. Hovering your cursor over the icons will tell you what they do but they are also listed top to bottom below. 

![](img/CX_Plot_ResetZoom.png) Resets the plot so it is fully zoomed out on both axes. 

![](img/CX_Plot_Scatter.png) Turns the plot into a scatter plot. 

![](img/CX_Plot_Line.png) Turns the plot into a line plot.

![](img/CX_Plot_Bar.png) Turns the plot into a bar graph.

![](img/CX_Plot_SaveAsImage.png) Saves the plot as a .png image. 

All plot pages default to displaying the last 60 minutes of data and refreshing every 10 minutes. Both of these are user configurable but keep in mind: the longer time interval you want to plot, the longer it will take to load. You can also refresh the plots at any time by clicking the page refresh button in your browser. 

## Combination
These plots are configurable in the Parameters list. They are meant to help users create specific plots relevant to their cruise. These plots will stay on the page as a dashboard for a user. 

## Customizable
This pages allows users to quickly create plots with any date range and up to four parameters of their choice.
