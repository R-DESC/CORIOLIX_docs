# Sensor Plots Pages

The sensor plots pages are system specific (Flowthrough & Meteorological) groupings of 2-D instrument real-time displays.  The sensor plots pages provide an integrated (overlay) display of all sensors belonging to a system for quick and easy visual comparison.  We also include a data access interface on each sensor plots page.  A customizable plots page is included for user difined sensor plotting.
