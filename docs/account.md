## User scope:
Currently, accounts are managed on a per-vessel basis.  That means that we do not yet synchronize your account across the various CORIOLIX vessel specific deployments.  So, if you want to use more on CORIOLIX user interface, Endeavor and Oceanus for example, you will need to create an account on both systems.

We do synchronize account information between the ship side CORIOLIX installation and the shoreside CORIOLIX installation.  So, you only need to have one account per vessel.  You will use the same username and password for accessing CORIOLIX on the ship as you would on the shore.

## Creating an account for the first time:
Browse to the CORIOLIX site relative to the vessel you are interested in:

* https://coriolix.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/oceanus
* https://coriolix.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/endeavor

From the site navigation options select: *My Account > Create New Account*
Complete the User Profile setup form and select the *Submit* button.
