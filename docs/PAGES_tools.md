# Cruise Tools Page

The cruise tools page navigation provides three options:

* Cruise List - A listing of currently scheduled (and past) cruises for the vessel (from MFP or user defined).
* Add New Cruise - A form for adding a new cruise.
* Cruise Event Log - A link to the event log for the current cruise.

## Cruise List
Displays all known cruises in the CORIOLIX system.  Use the links to access planning infomrmation retrieved from MFP and stored locally.  At this time, only the "Event Log" link is functional.

## Add New Cruise
When operating without MFP, use the "Add New Cruise" form to create cruise metadata.
