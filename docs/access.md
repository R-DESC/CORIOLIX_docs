# CORIOLIX URL's
Please note that we currently maintain three public facing CORIOLIX websites, one for system demonstration, one as a test deployment on Oceanus and another as a test deployment for Endeavor.  For the demonstration system there is only a shoreside interface.  The shipboard deployments include both a shoreside and shipboard user interfaces.

## CORIOLIX Demonstration Site:  
The CORIOLIX demonstration site is meant to provide an always on, always at sea, demonstration of the CORIOLIX system.  All data are simulated for the demonstration.
