# Administration — Getting Started (Overview)

This is the top-level admin landing page. It provides a short orientation and direct links to the detailed Administration subpages — it intentionally does not repeat the step-by-step content already provided in those subpages.

## Purpose

Quick orientation for Marine Technicians and IT staff: where to find installation, upgrade, log management, and sensor integration procedures.

## What this page contains

- A short orientation and quick-start pointers.
- Direct links to detailed guides (installation, upgrading, logs, sensor onboarding).
- A simple three-step quick start to get an admin up and running.

## Quick start (3 steps)

1. Review the Installation Guide to confirm prerequisites and deploy the system.
2. Confirm connectivity and check the Log Management page for recent system events.
3. Begin sensor integration using the Sensor Integration Overview and the numbered onboarding steps.
