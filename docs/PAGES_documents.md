# Documents Page

The Documents page contains a list of all documents associated with your ship. This includes calibration files, images, sensor manuals, and other vendor-supplied information that has been uploaded to CORIOLIX. Documents linked to a specific sensor, such as a manual or calibration file, can also be found on the appropriate Sensor Info pages.
