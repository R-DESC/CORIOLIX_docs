## Vocabularies & Codes

The Vocabularies & Codes page lists the external standards and code systems used within CORIOLIX.

### Overview

CORIOLIX uses internationally recognized vocabularies rather than locally defined terminology.

Each category links to an external standards organization that maintains the official terminology. These links are provided for:

- Transparency  
- Traceability  
- Technical reference  

Users do not need to visit these sites during normal operation. The vocabularies define the standardized terms used in dropdown menus and metadata fields.

---

### Why External Vocabularies Are Used

Using established external standards:

- Prevents inconsistent naming  
- Ensures compatibility with national data repositories  
- Supports integration with ERDDAP  
- Improves long-term data archiving  
- Aligns shipboard data with international conventions  

These vocabularies are maintained and periodically updated by external organizations.

### What This Means for Users

- CORIOLIX does not create its own terminology.  
- Dropdown selections use internationally maintained standards.  
- Names and codes remain consistent across vessels and repositories.  
- Data exported from CORIOLIX aligns with global marine data standards.  

For most users, these standards operate in the background.
